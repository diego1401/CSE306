The report for the assignment can be found in the report folder.

How to run this code and change the scene:
- Go to scene.cpp
- See how to create a sphere and look at its many parameters (mirror, light, transparent).
- If you want to add a mesh be careful to change the filenames in lines 100-101.
- If you want to add a mesh you might need to translate it and resize it.
- Choose a number of samples in main.cpp. Mirrors, and transparent surfaces usually need more samples. See report for examples.
